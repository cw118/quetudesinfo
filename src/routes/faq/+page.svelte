  <div id="cegep-desc" class="collapse mt-2">
      <p>CEGEP is the acronym for Quebec's <em>Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel</em>, a type of post-secondary institution
      specific to the province. CEGEPs are meant to help students transition from high school to university or the workforce.</p>

      <p>A DES = <em>Diplôme d'études secondaires</em>. It's the French abbreviation for the Quebec high school diploma and is identical to the DSS.</p>

      <p>The R-Score is a score computed for each course taken by a student in CEGEP. R-Scores use correction factors to indicate
      a student's rank in their group: calculations take into account not only your academic performance in a college course,
      but also group strength (academic strength and performance of your classmates), allowing Quebec universities to better
      compare applicants for admissions purposes even if applicants attended different CEGEPs.</p>

  <div id="cegep-admissions-grades" class="collapse mt-2">
      <p>CEGEPs look at all of your secondary 4 and 5 grades. Core subjects, which are those with ministerial exams such as
      secondary 5 English and French, are usually given more importance. Multiple averages are also calculated—depending on
      the program, an overall average, math/science average, social science average, etc. will be taken into account.</p>

  <div id="cegep-admissions-eca" class="collapse mt-2">
      <p>Typically, no. CEGEPs only look at your high school grades, unless your program requires a letter of intent or you're
      applying for a scholarship/bursary (many require a letter of intent and/or your curriculum vitae), where you may mention
      extracurricular activities and other non scholastic experiences. <em>Some colleges allow students to submit an explanatory
      letter if they feel that their academic record is not a true indication of their ability.</em></p>

  <div id="prereq-cutoffs" class="collapse mt-2">
      <p>Prerequisites are the credits that must be obtained in order to be eligible for admission to a program. For example,
      students applying to a Science program must have acquired, or be in the course of completing secondary 5 math TS/SN
      (506), secondary V Physics (504) and secondary V Chemistry (504).</p>
      <p>Cutoffs are the minimum grades required in order to be eligible for admission to a program. For example, students
      applying to John Abbott's Enriched Science program must minimally have an 85% overall average, as well as a grade of 80%
      in each science and math prerequisite course.</p>

  <div id="conditional-acceptance" class="collapse mt-2">
      <p>When you submit your CEGEP applications, you evidently do not yet have your final secondary 5 grades. Conditional
      acceptance simply means that in order to keep your spot at a CEGEP, you must still meet program requirements at the end
      of the year (they will check your final results), including a secondary school diploma and all prerequisite courses with
      appropriate grades.</p>

      <p>Depending on the CEGEP you're applying to, the application process will vary slightly. Start by accessing the

  <div id="two-vs-threeyear" class="collapse mt-2">
      <p>Two-year programs are more precisely called pre-university programs, while three-year programs refer to career/technical
      programs. Both types lead to a DCS (CEGEP diploma).</p>
      <p>Pre-university programs focus on a discipline, offering a somewhat rigid set of courses with enough flexibility for
      students to probe into other subject areas. These are generally two years in duration. If you wish to attend university after CEGEP, it is recommended that you choose a pre-university program.</p>
      <p>Technical programs <em>(also called career programs)</em> are three-year programs designed to integrate students into the
      workforce directly after graduation. They provide technical training, offering specialized courses that concentrate on
      the chosen field.</p>

      <p>Depending on your situation, there are several factors to consider when choosing a CEGEP—location, finances, program
      options and extracurriculars are among some of them.</p>
      <p>It's a good idea to visit the CEGEPs during open houses, sit in on classes with Student-for-a-Day, meet with your

      <p>Other things to factor into your decision include the program type (pre-university/technical) and your interests—the

  <div id="program-vs-profile" class="collapse mt-2">
      <p>A profile is essentially a more specific path of a program, just like science branches out to different subjects
      <em>(Physics, Chemistry, and Biology are all part of the term "science")</em>. Not all programs have profiles; profiles are often
      just referred to as programs for simplicity <em>(most just say "Health science program" rather than "Health science
      profile")</em>.</p>
      <p>For example, the Social Science program has numerous profiles like Psychology, General Social Science, Commerce, and
      Child Studies—and since they're all part of the Social Science program, students in any of these profiles will graduate
      with a DCS in Social Science.</p>

  <div id="honours" class="collapse mt-2">
      <p>Honours programs are great for avid learners! They offer more enriched course material, more learning opportunities
      outside the classroom including extra labs, activities and seminars. In general, Honours students write the same final exams
      as those in the regular program, so there's no need to worry about getting penalized as an Honours student. <em>Honours
      programs are sometimes called Enriched programs.</em></p>
      <p>Note that while your diploma will not state that you took an Honours program <em>(same diploma as students in the regular
      program)</em>, many CEGEPs provide Honours students with an attestation that can be included in university applications.</p>

      <p>As QUÉtudes-info does not have any information on CEGEP finances, you'll need to visit the official college sites. If
      you hold a temporary visa and are unsure whether you're required to pay a non-Quebec resident fee for CEGEP, see the
      question directly below and/or consult the <em><a href="https://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/public/services/finance_department/quebecresidenceformenglish.pdf" target="_blank">Attestation of Québec Resident Status form</a></em>.</p>

  <div id="quebec-resident" class="collapse mt-2">
      <p>Firstly, if you're not a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or Aboriginal person in Canada, you must pay the
      additional tuition fees prescribed for foreign students. (These criteria and tuition amounts are determined by the
      government.)</p>
      <p>Secondly, there are 14 situations in which you may qualify as a Quebec resident. If you claim Quebec resident status and
      have it recognized by your CEGEP, you will be exempt from any non-Quebec resident fees. See Part B of the <em>Attestation of Québec Resident Status form</em> here to verify your status: <a href="https://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/public/services/finance_department/quebecresidenceformenglish.pdf"

  <div id="site-secure" class="collapse mt-2">
      <p>Yes. Our site is secured with HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and uses a safe subdomain, <code>github.io</code>, which is
      inherited from the GitHub Pages website hosting service. (GitHub is a web-based repository-hosting service used by
      developers all around the globe for easy collaboration and version control.)</p>
