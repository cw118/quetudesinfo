                    but also group strength (academic strength and performance of your classmates), allowing Quebec universities to better
                    compare applicants for admissions purposes even if applicants attended different CEGEPs.</p>

                    <p>CEGEPs look at all of your secondary 4 and 5 grades. Core subjects, which are those with ministerial exams such as
                    secondary 5 English and French, are usually given more importance. Multiple averages are also calculated—depending on
                    the program, an overall average, math/science average, social science average, etc. will be taken into account.</p>

                    <p>Typically, no. CEGEPs only look at your high school grades, unless your program requires a letter of intent or you're
                    applying for a scholarship/bursary (many require a letter of intent and/or your curriculum vitae), where you may mention
                    extracurricular activities and other non scholastic experiences. <em>Some colleges allow students to submit an explanatory

                    (506), secondary V Physics (504) and secondary V Chemistry (504).</p>
                    <p>Cutoffs are the minimum grades required in order to be eligible for admission to a program. For example, students
                    applying to John Abbott's Enriched Science program must minimally have an 85% overall average, as well as a grade of 80%
                    in each science and math prerequisite course.</p>

                    profile”)</em>.</p>

                    programs are sometimes called Enriched programs.</em></p>

                    Wi-Fi. If that's not the issue, it may be that the page you're viewing contains functionality with which your device or
                    browser isn't compatible. (This is likely the case if you use an old or outdated device/browser.)</p>

                    is used in the tool's code to allow users to select a program <em>(you need to choose a CEGEP first to activate the program select menu!)</em>.</p>
