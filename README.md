## Participation guidelines

The goal of QUÃ‰tudes-info is to inform and to help the community. Please follow our participation guidelines to maintain a healthy, friendly and welcoming community. Know how you should conduct yourself, and understand *unacceptable* conduct as well. *(These guidelines are heavily based on those of [MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community#participation-guideline-highlights).)*

### Be respectful

Treat everyone with respect and kindness. Value each other's ideas, styles, and points of view. Good manners are important and expected even in disagreement or conflict.

### Be inclusive

Seek and appreciate diverse perspectives â€” diversity of views is enriching. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs: work to eliminate biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices, think and accommodate a variety of points of view.

### Understand different perspectives

Be open to ideas and solutions that can improve and contribute to the project. Our goal is not to "win" disagreements or arguments.

### Lead by example

Guide others to be respectful and inclusive. Inspire them to make good decisions and to create a welcoming community.

### Unacceptable behaviours

- **Disruptive behaviour**
- **Violence and threats of violence**, online or offline.
- **Personal attacks**: conflicts should be resolved calmly, and frustration should never turn into personal attacks (i.e. insulting, demeaning or belittling others).
- **Derogatory language**: don't use a word if it *may* be considered derogative (i.e. you're unsure that it is derogatory). This includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop a certain behaviour, *stop*.
- **Unwelcome sexual attention**: sexualised comments, as well as jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials will *not* be tolerated.
