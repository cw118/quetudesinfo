# Contributing to QUÉtudes-info

QUÉtudes-info has a *lot* of information, which makes it quite difficult to maintain and keep up-to-date. Any help, from correcting typos and updating facts/information to improving code and stylesheets, would be greatly appreciated!

**IMPORTANT:** QUÉtudes-info's prose content is available under the [CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://github.com/cw118/quetudesinfo/blob/main/LICENSE.md#license-for-all-prose-content), while the source code is available under the [MPL 2.0 license](https://github.com/cw118/quetudesinfo/blob/main/LICENSE.md#license-for-all-source-code). ***All contributions you make to this repository will be available under these licenses as well!***

As the maintainer, I now have a significantly smaller amount of time to work on this project, but I do my best. If there are questions regarding contributions, you can ping me (@cw118) **if needed**.
