                <p class="p-disclaimer lightyellow-bg"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Please note that the pages in this section contain general guidelines, and that following them does <u>not</u> guarantee any outcomes, including but not
                    limited to successful completion of an application, successful submission of an application, admission to a college,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>Applying to CEGEP is an exciting but perhaps stressful occasion for all students. It can be tricky to decide what
                programs to apply to at various colleges, figuring out what documents you need and what fees to pay. Then on top of all that,
                most CEGEPs use different application modules, which means a different application process for nearly every CEGEP!</p>
                <p>In the <strong>Applying to CEGEP</strong> section, we’ll cover everything you need to know: we’ll look at the steps of numerous application processes using
                different modules, provide some tips and resources, remind you of important dates and deadlines, and more. This specific page will focus on CEGEP admissions and how applications are evaluated.</p>
                <p>If you’re a high school student, you’ll want to apply for the Fall semester in the Day Division (regular day programs),
                which is exactly what this section will go over. Here’s a rough outline of what an application process typically
                involves:</p>
                <ul class="ul-blue">
                    <li>Choose some programs of interest</li>
                    <li>Find which CEGEPs offer your programs of interest, learn about their school community, resources, finances, etc.</li>
                    <li>Fall and/or Winter: Visit CEGEPs for open houses and/or information sessions (virtual or in-person) and get to know the
                    colleges more
                        <ul class="inner">
                            <li>You can also sign up for Student-for-a-Day, which allows you to visit several college classes, meet some faculty, and
                            get a feel of what it’s like to be a student at a CEGEP.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When application modules open (January for the Fall semester): begin college applications</li>
                    <li>Keep track of deadlines (March 1 application deadline for Fall semester)</li>
                    <li>Complete and submit applications: ensure all necessary documents were sent in, then wait for results</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="yellow-bg" id="admissions">CEGEP Admissions</h2>
                <p>There's often a lot of confusion surrounding CEGEP admissions. When they evaluate your application, what do the
                admissions teams actually look at? What are the grades they care about most?</p>
                <p class="p-disclaimer"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Disclaimer: This section does not describe the exact process taken by any CEGEP admissions team and is meant to give a
                general idea of how you may be evaluated in comparison to other applicants.</p>
                <h3 class="lightyellow-bg mb-1">Secondary 4 Results</h3>
                <p>As you may already know, CEGEPs only look at your secondary 4 and 5 credits and grades. Core courses, especially those
                with ministerial exams, are weighted more heavily (more details on this later). In normal circumstances, secondary 4
                math, science and history courses would be given greater importance/weight.</p> 
                <p>For the <u>2020–21 school year</u> (secondary 4 for this year’s cohort), there were two high school terms. Term 1 was worth 35%, and term 2 was worth 65% <em>(a change may have been made, modifying the weighting to 40% and 60% instead)</em>.</p>
                <h3 class="lightyellow-bg mb-1">Secondary 5 Results</h3>
                <p>Since secondary 5 students apply to CEGEP before they’ve completed the school year, CEGEPs will first consider term 1 grades upon receiving applications; term 2 grades will then be verified after the end of the school year (more on this in <a href="#conditional-acceptance">Conditional Acceptance</a>). Core
                courses, especially those with ministerial exams (English and French), are weighted more heavily. For the <u>2021–22 school year</u>, term weighting was confirmed as 40% for term 1 and 60% for term 2 <em>(may be subject to change)</em></p>

                <h2 class="skyblue-bg" id="evaluating-applications">Evaluating Applications</h2>
                <p>The information presented on this part of the page is largely based on Loyola High School’s presentation on 2020 CEGEP
                Applications, which can be found here: <a href="https://loyola.ca/images/articlemedia/students/2019-2020/2020_-_CEGEP_Applications__Parent.pdf" target="_blank">https://loyola.ca/images/articlemedia/students/2019-2020/2020_-_CEGEP_Applications__Parent.pdf</a></p>
                <h3 class="lightyellow-bg mb-1">What CEGEPs see</h3>
                <p>CEGEPs consider students’ grades and compare them to the class/group average. For most programs, your grades will also
                be compared to cutoffs (minimum required averages and grades, vary based on program). Below is an image depicting what
                admissions teams see:</p>
                <img src="cegep-hsgrades.png" class="xsmall-img" alt="Table with school code, student permanent code, course code, grade earned, and class or group average">
                <p>The permanent code is a unique identifier assigned to each Quebec student, consisting of a 12 character code that is
                found on report cards and achievement records. The course code is a 6 character code representing a course, such as
                132506 for <em>Français langue seconde, enrichi</em>.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-2" id= "sram-admissions">SRAM: Vanier, John Abbott, Champlain Lennoxville, Heritage</h3>
                <p><em>SRAM stands for Service régional d'admission du Montréal métropolitain, and students can apply to several CEGEPs through
                SRAM. See <a href="https://cw118.github.io/quetudesinfo/application-systems">Application Systems</a> for more details.</em></p>

                </div>
                
                <p>SRAM-affiliated CEGEPs use <strong>ranking lists</strong> when evaluating applications to determine the eligibility of applicants, to
                compare them to one another, and to select the best-suited candidates for limited enrolment programs. <strong>SRAM rankings</strong> are
                determined based on the following:</p>
                <ul class="ul-blue">
                    <li><strong>All secondary 4 and 5 grades</strong>: an overall average is calculated based on credit weight (the number of credits of a course determines its weight in the
                    average)</li>
                    <li><strong>Average deviations</strong>: the student's grade in comparison to the group average for each course</li>
                    <li><strong>Optional courses</strong>: bonuses are given to students who pass optional courses Secondary V TS/SN Math, Chemistry, or Physics</li>
                    <li><strong>Core subjects</strong> and <strong>"heavy subjects"</strong> (subjects related to your CEGEP program):
                        <ul class="inner">
                            <li>When applying to English-language CEGEPs, English is always a “heavy subject”, meaning it is given greater importance</li>
                            <li>Core subjects typically refer to courses with ministerial exams</li>
                            <li>Subjects related to a Science program would include all Science and Math courses: TS/SN Math, Science and Technology,
                            Environmental Science and Technology, Physics, Chemistry, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Number of credits</strong>: all high school applicants graduate with a minimum of 54 credits, but some will obtain a higher number. A bonus is given
                    to students who hold between 64 and 88 high school credits</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="yellow-bg" id="conditional-acceptance">Conditional Acceptance</h2>
                <p>CEGEPs look at <strong>all of your secondary 4 and 5 grades, including the final term of secondary 5</strong> <em>(typically the third term
                in normal circumstances, but in recent years it has been the second term)</em>. But how exactly does this work if you don’t
                even have those marks when you submit your applications?</p>
                <p>Once you get accepted at a CEGEP, you’re offered a spot under something called <strong>conditional acceptance</strong>. Conditional
                acceptance means that <u>there are still requirements, or conditions, that you must fulfill by the end of the school year
                for your acceptance to be finalized</u>. In other words, your final high school grades must also meet the requirements and
                you must complete all of your college program prerequisites in order to keep your spot at a CEGEP.</p>
