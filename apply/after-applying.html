                    <p>Now that you've submitted your applications, paid your application fees, and sent and/or uploaded all required
                    documents, there's not much left to do besides waiting for results. And then once <em>that's</em> over, what comes next?</p>
                    <p>As you've likely noticed while completing your CEGEP applications, application systems give you the option of viewing
                    your application or file status. This is what allows you to verify that you completed all components of your application
                    (<u>before</u> the deadline), access the notice of decision and more!</p>
                    <p>In addition, once you accept an offer of admission from a college, you may be asked to take placement tests/exams. You
                    will also, at some point, be choosing your first semester courses—as you may already know, all CEGEP students (enrolled
                    in English-language CEGEPs) are required to pass 4 English, 2 French, 3 Humanities and 3 Physical Education courses.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>After applying</strong> page covers all of these topics thoroughly, and aims to help you feel prepared even after completing your CEGEP
                    applications. Now, let's get started with how to check application status!</p>

                    <h2 class="yellow-bg" id="status-confirm">Application Status and Confirming Acceptance</h2>
                    <p>Around <strong>mid-March and the beginning of April, CEGEPs will start sending out admissions decisions</strong>; final decisions are usually made by May.
                    Applicants will thus need to <strong>check their application status</strong> for the CEGEPs they applied to, and if accepted, <strong>reply to
                    the colleges in order to confirm or cancel their admission</strong> (acceptance): depending on the CEGEP, you'll need to <strong>send an
                    email OR use the application module to confirm/cancel</strong>. When you've reached the stage of acceptance confirmation and/or
                    cancellation, <strong>keep an eye out for the deadlines</strong>—be sure to reply before the prescribed date and time!</p>
                    <p>Remember to <strong>check your email frequently</strong>, so as to not miss important updates and notifications. In addition, <strong>when
                    confirming admission to CEGEP, do NOT hoard spots!</strong></p>
                    <p><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> <strong>Acceptance is always <u>conditional</u>, meaning that keeping your spot at a CEGEP is contingent on your final grades and
                    whether or not you still meet the requirements at the end of the year.</strong> This is often called <strong>conditional admission</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In other words, final admission into any CEGEP program requires that you obtain a DES (secondary diploma), including all
                    prerequisite courses with appropriate grades. If you do not meet the requirements at the end of the year (CEGEPs usually
                    verify this in July), your offer of admission may be withdrawn.</p>

                    <p><strong>Many CEGEPs have students switch to another platform once they're admitted.</strong> The most common platform is called <em>Omnivox</em>, which a few colleges also use for applications, but admitted students
                    typically access it through a different portal.</p>
                    <p><strong>Follow the instructions provided by your CEGEP to access their platform for admitted students</strong>—this is crucial, as it's usually where you choose your courses, find important dates (such as student orientation),
                    view and download your college schedules, access your course grades and more. <strong>Make sure to check the platform (log in to your student portal) periodically</strong>, and to fulfill any requirements (submit

                    <p>And that's all you really need to know about CEGEP applications and follow-ups! We hope you found this section and <a href="/quetudesinfo/apply/application-systems">our
                    Application Systems page</a> helpful.</p>
                    <p>Next up are some details about what comes after getting admitted to a college, including placement tests and a basic
                    guide to the CEGEP courses required for graduation.</p>
                    <p><em>More information on confirming acceptance is (hopefully) coming soon.</em></p>

                    <h2 class="skyblue-bg" id="placement-tests">Accepted at CEGEP: Placement Tests</h2>
                    <p>Placement tests are essentially diagnostic tests used to <strong>place students at the correct level for certain courses</strong>. And
                    don't worry, these tests aren't used to withdraw offers of admission—placement test results won't affect your admission
                    to CEGEP. The college simply needs to identify the best course stream for you so that you can succeed when you begin
                    your studies at CEGEP.</p>
                    <p>Most colleges require that new students take an <strong>English placement test</strong>. Those who may need more support in English are
                    placed in a preparatory course; otherwise, students will take Introduction to College English <em>(types and level of
                    English courses are explained in depth in <a href="#college-course-overview">Overview of College Courses</a>)</em>.</p>
                    <p>Some CEGEPs also require a <strong>French placement test</strong>, though most use high school French grades to measure aptitudes. There
                    are four levels of French in English-language colleges, as well as preparatory courses for those who may need more
                    support in French. <em>(Types and levels of French courses are explained in depth in <a href="#college-course-overview">Overview of College Courses</a>.)</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Check your student portal and official CEGEP sites to see which placement tests you'll need to write</strong>, as they vary with CEGEP and the student's situation. It's important that you write the tests required of you in order
                    to register for courses.</p>

                    <h2 class="yellow-bg" id="college-course-overview">Overview of College Courses</h2>

                    <p><strong>CEGEP course codes</strong> are 8 characters long, formatted as such: XXX-YYY-ZZ. The first three characters, XXX, are always numbers and indicate
                    the discipline or subject that the course belongs to (603 = English, 201 = Math, 203 = Physics, 350 = Psychology, 607 =
                    Spanish, etc.).</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The next three, YYY, usually specify the level or specialization of the course within its category, depending on the
                    discipline. They tend to be all numbers or all letters (for example, NYA or 101).</p>
                    <p>You don't really need to worry about the last two characters, ZZ, since they're rarely the same for each CEGEP. Some
                    Ministry-required courses like English and French will end with MQ, while some CEGEPs end all course codes with their
                    own extension (for example, Vanier College uses VA as the last two characters for all course codes).</p>
                    <p>Here are a few example course codes <em>(these vary by CEGEP)</em>:</p>
                    <ul class="ul-blue">
                        <li>201-NYA-05 = Calculus I</li>
                        <li>420-201-VA = Introduction to Programming, at Vanier College (notice the -VA at the end of the code)</li>
                        <li>202-NYB-05 = General Chemistry II (also called Chemistry of Solutions)</li>
                        <li>360-300-MS = Quantitative Methods, Marianopolis College (ends with -MS)</li>
                        <li>510-ASA-AB = Art I, John Abbott College (ends with -AB)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>To indicate the number of hours to be spent on each course, CEGEPs use a weighting system (pondération) of three digits
                    in the form of X-Y-Z.</strong> This is being explained here in case you're wondering what something like a 2-2-4 in a program description means, but
                    don't worry too much about this number/value when choosing your courses.</p>
                    <ul class="ul-blue">
                        <li>The first digit (X) = number of classroom instruction hours per week</li>
                        <li>The second digit (Y) = number of lab hours (spent in a specialized/multipurpose room) or internship hours per week</li>
                        <li>The third digit (Z) = number of personal work hours the student should put in per week (outside of class and lab time). <em>Note that this is more of an estimate than an absolute number of hours.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, if a CEGEP course has 2-1-3 as its weighting, then:</p>
                    <ul class="ul-blue">
                        <li>First digit is 2 = two hours of formal classroom instruction per week</li>
                        <li>Second digit is 1 = one lab hour per week</li>
                        <li>Third digit is 3 = three hours of personal work for this course per week</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>When choosing college courses, the course time and professor are important to consider.</strong> To increase your chances of finding an enjoyable course and a good professor, ask around—if you're able to ask former or
                    current college students for their opinions and recommendations, great! If not, you can also do a bit of research on
                    your own: read the professor's research papers, watch interviews, etc. <em>Another common method used by students is the site "Rate My Teacher", but we advise against relying on this.</em></p>
