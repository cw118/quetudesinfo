                    <p>Here is where we'll go over the different application systems and modules used by each English-language CEGEP, as well
                    as walk through the <strong>Fall Session</strong> application process for <strong>regular Quebec students</strong> in high school <u>(simply put: adolescents in secondary 5 in a Quebec high school)</u>.</p>
                    <p>When you start an application, you'll see that you can apply as either a Quebec student, a Canadian (out-of-province)
                    student, or an international student. The three categories are defined by <strong>where you're studying when you apply to CEGEP</strong>,
                    as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="ul-blue">
                        <li><strong>Quebec student:</strong> applicants from/studying in a Quebec institution (usually a Quebec high school)</li>

                        <li><strong>International student:</strong> pplicants from/studying in an international institution, outside of Canada</li>
                        <li>There may also be an option for Transfer Students, which is for students already studying at a Quebec CEGEP wishing to
                        transfer to another college.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="p-disclaimer lightyellow-bg"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> For international students <u>already in Quebec</u> (even if you don't have Canadian citizenship or permanent residence): as
                    long as you are studying in Quebec when you apply, you apply as a Quebec student. “Quebec student” and <a href="https://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/public/services/finance_department/quebecresidenceformenglish.pdf" target="_blank">“Quebec resident”</a>
                    are defined separately at the CEGEP level, so while you may not qualify as the latter (resident), you are considered a Quebec student if you
                    study in a Quebec high school. (Do NOT apply as an international student!)</p>
                    <p>Some systems use different categories, but not to worry, those will be explained in the sections pertaining to each
                    individual system.</p>
                    <p>It's also important to know that <strong>if you are <u>not</u> an adult in Continuing Education, you will be applying to what's called the <u>day division</u> for a <u>day
                    program</u></strong> to study full-time in a DEC (DCS) program. A few systems will categorize Day Division students as <strong>regular applicants</strong>.</p>
