                <p><strong>Pre-university programs</strong> lead to a Diploma of College Studies (DCS) in the program that you study and prepare you for university undergraduate
                studies. Most of these are four semesters (two years) long. <em>Some pre-university programs are three years in duration because they combine two areas of study (more on this in
                Special programs).</em></p>

                <p>For pre-university programs, there is a program-specific component (a college graduation requirement) consisting of a
                certain number of credits, which vary depending on what program you take:</p>
                <ul class="ul-blue">
                    <li>32 credits in Science, Computer Science and Mathematics, Music, and Visual Arts</li>
                    <li>30 to 31 1/3 credits in social sciences</li>
                    <li>30 credits in Arts, Literature and Communication (ALC)</li>
                    <li>28 credits in Dance</li>
                    <li>36 2/3 or 38 credits in Arts and Sciences</li>
                    <li>34 to 35 1/3 credits in Liberal Arts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What does this mean? If you take the Science, Computer Science and Mathematics, Music, or Visual Arts program, you must
                obtain 32 credits specific to your program (<em>not sure what the program-specific component is? See <a href="/quetudesinfo/whatiscegep#dcs">Diploma of Collegial Studies</a></em>). If you take a Social Science program/profile (see below), you must obtain 30 to 31 ⅓ program-specific credits; if you
                take the Arts, Literature and Communication program, it's 30 credits, and so on.</p>
                <br><p><strong>Career and technical programs</strong> are usually three years in duration and also lead to a DCS. They provide technical training and are designed to
                integrate students into the workforce. Sometimes these are simply referred to as career programs, technical programs, or
                three-year programs.</p>
                <p>In addition to the General Education component, technical programs require students to complete 15 to 31 courses in
                field-specific subjects of varying lengths depending on the program. Most of these programs also include co-op and/or
                internships.</p>

                </div>

                <br><p><strong>Profiles:</strong> A profile is quite similar in definition to a program, but taking any profile will still lead to a program diploma; it's
                like a subject or option within the program field of study. One way to identify the profiles of a program is by looking at the program code <em>(see below)</em>—typically, profiles of the same program <strong>share at least the first three digits</strong> of the program code. <em>Note that profiles are sometimes referred to as programs for simplicity, such as the Health Science profile/program.</em></p>
                <p>For example, the Commerce profile of the Social Science program is just a more specific branch of its parent program,
                and you will still receive a DCS (diploma) in Social Science (not Commerce). All Social Science profiles also share a code of 300.</p>
                <p>Another example would be taking Health Science—it's technically a profile of the Science program, so you will still get DCS in Science whether you take Health
                Science, Pure and Applied Science, etc. All Science profiles share a code of 200.</p>
                
                <br><p>A <strong>program code</strong> (also called <strong>profile code</strong>) is a unique identifier for a program and/or profile. Program codes are typically the same in all CEGEPs, and they are 5 characters long, formatted as such: XXX.xx</p>
                <p>The first 3 characters (XXX) are numbers, representing the program/diploma subject, followed by 2 characters (xx)
                representing the specific profile. For example, the code <strong>300.FA</strong> is for the General Social Science profile, <strong>300.FB</strong> is for the Commerce profile, and <strong>300.FP</strong> is for the Psychology profile. All three of these are considered to be <strong>profiles of the Social Science program</strong>—notice that they share a common three-digit code of <strong>300</strong>.</p>

                <br><p><strong>Program prerequisites (admission/entrance requirements)</strong> are the credits and/or courses that you must take in order to be admissible to a program/profile. Another possible
                prerequisite is a <u>letter of intent</u>—a brief, focused essay (around 1 page) covering various topics such as why you're
                interested in the program, why the college should consider you, your interests and passions, and your school and
                community involvement.</p>
                <p>The <a href="/quetudesinfo/whatiscegep#quebec-school-system">general CEGEP entrance requirement</a> is a Quebec Secondary School Diploma (SSD), but most programs have additional prerequisites and <u>cutoff grades</u> listed as well.</p>
                <p>A cutoff grade is the lowest grade acceptable for applicants of a particular program. Cutoffs are often listed for math
                courses (secondary IV and V math TS or SN). Common cutoff averages are overall average (average of grades in all
                subjects), math average (average of all math grades), and science average (average of all math and science grades, also
                called science/math average).</p>
                <p>For example, the Science program at a CEGEP may set an overall average cutoff at 80%, meaning students who wish to apply to
                the Science program at that college must have a minimum overall average of 80%.</p>

                <p>This is a very general and incomplete list meant to give you an idea of what kinds of programs CEGEPs may offer. For a bit more information on this site, try <a href="/quetudesinfo/apply/choose-a-cegep-program">Choosing a CEGEP and Program</a>. <strong>For full details on a CEGEP and their prorams, <a href=https://cw118.github.io/quetudesinfo/links">visit their official site and/or see their viewbook.</a></strong></p>

                <p class="p-disclaimer lightyellow-bg"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Not all possibilities are included, and not all CEGEPs offer what's mentioned here.</p>

                <p><strong>Springboard to a DCS (081.06)</strong> — for a semester (time and duration may vary), students can take a course selection before switching into a regular DCS program. Depending on the
                college and pathway, Springboard may be an option for students missing prerequisites for admission to another program,
                who are unsure of what program to pursue, or who require more time and assistance before beginning a regular CEGEP
                program. A secondary school diploma is still required for this program, and Springboard itself does <strong>not</strong> lead to a DCS. <a href="https://pygma.ca/08106" target="_blank">Research this program as well as your programs and colleges of interest carefully if you think Springboard may be for
                you.</a></p>
                <p><strong>Computer Science and Mathematics (200.C0)</strong> — this is a two-year pre-university program that leads to a DCS (diploma) in Computer Science and Math. It's still a relatively
                new program and is currently only offered by 8 CEGEPs (French colleges included).</p>
                <p><strong>Double DEC programs (pre-university)</strong> — as the name suggests, double DEC programs combine two pre-university programs into one three-year program (still
                pre-university). Students thus receive one DEC each for both programs. If you're interested in two disciplines and want to explore them both, there may be a double DEC
                program that's right for you. <em>Some examples: Music and Science (a DEC in Music and a DEC in Science), Science and Social Science (a DEC in Science and a DEC in Social Science)...</em></p>
                <p><strong>Alliance Sport-Études</strong> — many colleges partner with Alliance Sport-Études to help elite student-athletes balance academics, athletic training and
                competition. This allows CEGEPs to offer adapted educational services to students; those in a high school Sport-Études
                program who wish to continue with their sport and studies may find this partnership beneficial.</p>

                <p><strong>Field Trips</strong> — many CEGEPs offer field trips to all students, or to students of a certain program. Research your colleges and programs of interest carefully for more information.</p>
                <p><strong>English and French programs/exchanges</strong> — some CEGEPs offer a certain program that you can take in a mix of English and French, which usually involves taking some
                courses at a French CEGEP. Similarly, certain colleges offer a bilingual exchange where students complete a semester at
                a French CEGEP. Research your colleges and programs of interest carefully for more information.</p>
                <p><strong>Exchange programs</strong> — some CEGEPs have international exchange programs that allow you to visit and study in another country. Research your
                colleges and programs of interest carefully for more information.</p>
