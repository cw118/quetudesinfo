                <h2 class="lightblue-bg" id="r-score">The R-Score</h2>
                <p><strong>The R-Score</strong>, officially the <em>cote de rendement au collégial (CRC)</em>, is <strong>a number or score you receive for each course you take in CEGEP</strong>. It's used for <strong>university admissions in
                Quebec</strong> to <strong>assess your academic performance</strong>. An <strong>overall R-Score</strong> is also calculated, which is the weighted average of all
                individual R-Scores from each of your courses—the number of credits a course is worth determines the weight of each
                course when calculating the overall R-Score. The <em><a href="https://www.bci-qc.ca/en/r-score/" target="_blank">Bureau de coopération interuniversitaire (BCI)</a></em> is responsible for
                calculating R-Scores.</p>
                <p><strong>Why does the R-Score exist?</strong> According to the BCI, two correction factors are used in the R-Score formula so that not only the student's own academic
                performance in a course is taken into account, but also the group strength and dispersion (academic strength and performance of your classmates). This adjustment is
                particularly important when it comes to Quebec university admissions, since applicants attend various CEGEPs across the
                province, forcing universities to compare students who were evaluated based on different college grading systems. In a nutshell,
                the R-Score was devised as <strong>a way to rank students more fairly</strong>.</p>
                <p>Now, on to the math! The concept of the R-Score and its formula can be confusing, but in the end, it really boils down to basic statistics.
                To know how the R-Score works, you'll first want to understand standard deviation and z-scores.</p>
                <p><strong>First, here's some vocabulary you should know:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deviation</strong> = how far from normal, from a norm, something is</li>
                    <li><strong>Data set</strong> = a collection of related values/data points (often numbers)</li>
                    <li><strong>Data point</strong> = an element (usually a number) in a data set</li>
                    <li><strong>Distribution</strong> = in statistics, distribution is the way in which something (usually data) is “spread out” or distributed</li>
                    <li><strong>Bias</strong> = in statistics, bias indicates that data is <strong>skewed</strong>, or more spread out, in a certain direction (left/right)
                        <ul class="inner">
                            <li><strong>Left-skewed</strong>= more spread out on the left</li>
                            <li><strong>Right-skewed</strong>= more spread out on the right</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2 class="yellow-bg" id="standard-deviation">Standard Deviation</h2>
                <p><strong>Standard deviation</strong> is the <u>measure of how spread out numbers are</u>, and is represented by the symbol &#963; (lowercase Greek letter sigma). It gives us a way of knowing “what's normal”. Now, the
                formula for standard deviation involves something called the <strong>variance</strong>, which we'll go ahead and define next.</p>
                <p>The definition of <strong>variance</strong> is the <u>average of squared differences from the mean</u>. There are three steps to calculating the variance:</p>
                <ol class="ol-blue">
                    <li>Calculate the mean of the data set.</li>
                    <li>For each data point: subtract the mean from the number <em>(even if the result is negative!)</em>, then square the result.</li>
                    <li>Calculate the average of all squared differences (from step 2).</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Here's an example with some people's heights:</strong></p>
                <p>For heights (standing, from head to toe) 157 cm, 160 cm, 172 cm, 165 cm and 181 cm, calculate the variance.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Calculate the data set mean: 157 + 160 + 172 + 165 + 181 = 835, there are five data points so 835 / 5 = <strong>167</strong></li>
                    <li>Calculate the squared mean differences:
                        <ol class="inner ol-blue">
                            <li>Subtract the mean from the number for each data point: 157 - 167 = <strong>-10</strong>, 160 - 167 = <strong>-7</strong>, 172 - 167 = <strong>5</strong>, 165 - 167 = <strong>-2</strong>, 181 - 167 = <strong>14</strong></li>
                            <li>Square each mean difference: (-10)<sup>2</sup> = <strong>100</strong>, (-7)<sup>2</sup> = <strong>49</strong>, (5)<sup>2</sup> = <strong>25</strong>, (-2)<sup>2</sup> = <strong>4</strong>, (14)<sup>2</sup> = <strong>196</strong></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Calculate the average of all squared differences: 100 + 49 + 25 + 4 + 196 = 374, there are five data points so 374 / 5 = <strong>74.8</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>&#8756; We can conclude that the variance of these heights is <strong>74.8</strong>.</p>
                <p>Now, to go from the variance to standard deviation is extremely simple. The definition of and formula for <u>standard deviation</u> is just the <u>square root of the variance</u>.</p>
                <p><strong>Let's calculate the standard deviation for the same data set:</strong></p>
                <ol class="ol-blue">
                    <li>Calculate the square root of the variance: &#8730;74.8 = 8.648699324 &#8776; <strong>8.6</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>&#8756; The standard deviation of the heights is (approximately) <strong>8.6 cm</strong>.</p><hr>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, standard deviation provides us with a standard whereby we can identify what's normal, and what
                values are further away from that standard (smaller, larger, etc.)—but how does the calculated value translate to this?</p>
                <p>Since variance and standard deviation are calculated based on the mean, the “normal” data points are determined in
                relation to the data set's mean. We can consider the <strong>mean</strong> to be the “most normal value”, then using the standard deviation, we can find the range of normal values. So you can
                almost think of standard deviation as a unit, designated by &#963;: in a <u>normal distribution</u> like the Bell Curve, <strong>values within 1 standard deviation of the mean</strong> are considered normal.</p>
                <p><strong>Let's find the “normal range” for our set of heights, where the <u>mean is 167</u> and the <u>standard deviation is 8.6</u>:</strong></p>
                <p class="full-indent text-blue">Any value <em>within</em> one standard deviation is normal, so we want to find a range where values that are <strong>one standard deviation <u>less</u></strong> than the mean are included, as well as values that are <strong>one standard deviation <u>greater</u></strong> than the mean.</p>
                <ol class="ol-indented ol-blue">
                    <li>The lower bound/minimum value: 167 - 8.6 = <strong>158.4</strong></li>
                    <li>The upper bound/maximum value: 167 + 8.6 = <strong>175.6</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>&#8756; We can conclude that for this data set, any value within the <strong>range of 158.4 - 175.6</strong> (that is, heights from 158.4 cm to 175.6 cm) is considered to be <strong>normal</strong>.</p><br>
                <p>In statistics, about <strong>68% of values</strong> in a normally distributed data set can be expected to be within plus-or-minus <u>one</u> standard deviation (&#177; 1&#963;), or within the
                “normal range”. As shown in the diagram below, we expect about <strong>95% of values</strong> to be within <strong>plus-or-minus <u>two</u> standard deviations</strong> (&#177; 2&#963;), then that percentage becomes <strong>99.7%</strong> within <strong>plus-or-minus-<u>three</u> standard deviations</strong> (&#177; 3&#963;).</p>
                <p>This is what we call the <strong>Empirical Rule</strong>, or the <strong>68-95-99.7 rule</strong> (or even the <strong>95 rule</strong>, as 95% is very commonly used as an interval).</p>
                <p><em>Recall that lowercase sigma </em>&#963; <em>is the symbol for standard deviation.</em></p>

                <p>Just one final detail before we move on: the calculations shown above are used for a <strong>population</strong>, meaning
                the data points we used were the only ones we were interested in. (We got heights from five people, and we only cared
                about the heights of those five people.)</p>
                <p>There's a small change when calculating variance and/or standard deviation for what's called a <strong>sample</strong>, a selection taken from a larger
                population. (We got heights from five people, and maybe we're using that data to represent a group of fifteen people or
                more.) However, since R-Score calculations likely use <strong>population data</strong> (data from all students concerned), we'll just focus on
                the calculations that were already presented and explained.</p>

                <h2 class="lightblue-bg" id="z-score">The Z-Score</h2>
                <p>A <strong>z-score</strong> measures, for a data point, <u>how many standard deviations above or below the mean</u> it is. Z-scores are also called <strong>standard scores</strong> in statistics.</p>
                <p>The formula for calculating a z-score is quite simple: you divide a data point's mean difference by the data set's
                standard deviation. It could be written like <strong>this:</strong> (data point - mean) / standard deviation = z-score</p>
                <p>Some key facts on z-scores:</p>
                <ul class="ul-blue">
                    <li>If a data point has a <strong>positive z-score</strong> (greater than 0), it's <strong>above average</strong> (<em>above the mean</em>)</li>
                    <li>If a data point has a <strong>negative z-score</strong> (less than 0), it's <strong>below average</strong> (<em>below the mean</em>)</li>
                    <li>If a z-score is <strong>close to 0</strong>, the data point is <strong>close to average</strong> (<em>close to/approaching the mean</em>)</li>
                    <li>Depending on the context, the general guideline is that <strong>z-scores above 3 or below -3 are considered unusual</strong>
                        <ul class="inner">
                            <li>Different people may use different ranges, such as &#177;2 or &#177;2.5</li>
                            <li>In R-Score calculations, we'll see later on that the BCI uses two different cutoffs pertaining to z-score components</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Why is it <strong>3 and -3</strong>?</em> Let's think back to the <strong>empirical rule</strong> with this diagram here:</p>
                <div class="image-label">
                    <p class="label">Empirical rule histogram</p>

                </div>
                <p><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> <em>The symbol </em>&#956; <em>is lowercase Greek letter "mu", which is statistical notation for the <strong>mean</strong>. Recall that a <u>z-score</u> is defined as <u>how many standard deviations above or below the <strong>mean</strong> a data point is</u>.</em></p>
                <p>Notice and recall that <strong>between plus-or-minus-<u>three</u> standard deviations</strong> (&#177; 3&#963;), around <strong>99.7% of values</strong> in a normal data set can be expected to fall within that range. To rephrase, we can expect around 99.7% of values in a normally distributed
                data set to fall within three standard deviations of the mean.</p>
                <p>So, if we think about this in terms of the z-score, this means that <strong>data points with a z-score between 3 and -3 fall within the three standard deviation range</strong>—a z-score of 3 means a data point is 3 standard deviations above the mean, and a z-score of -3 means a data point is 3 standard deviations below the mean. To put it simply, data points with a z-score between 3 and -3 represent those <strong>99.7%</strong> of values mentioned earlier.</p>
                <p>We can thus conclude that it would be <strong>extremely rare and unusual for a data point to fall outside of this range</strong> (&#177; 3&#963;, or for z-scores, between 3 and -3), where we expect a mere <strong>0.3%</strong> of values to be.</p><hr>
                <p><strong>Let's practise calculating z-scores with a couple of random examples:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The grades on a French midterm at Eastwood High have a mean of 85 and a standard deviation of 4. If George scored 86 on
                    the exam, what is the z-score for his exam grade?
                        <p>First, considering the z-score formula, (data point - mean) / standard deviation, we see that <strong>data point = George's exam grade = 86</strong>, <strong>mean = 85</strong>, and <strong>standard deviation = 4</strong>. Let's substitute those values in:</p>
                        <p><em>z</em> = (data point - mean) / standard deviation</p>
                        <p><em>z</em> = (86 - 85) / 4</p>
                        <p><em>z</em> = 1 / 4 = <strong>0.25</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-blue">&#8756; George's <strong>z-score is 0.25</strong>, meaning his grade is <strong>a quarter of a standard deviation <u>above</u> the mean</strong>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The grades on a history midterm at Eastwood High have a mean of 83 and a standard deviation of 2. George scored 79 on
                    the exam. What is his z-score for the history midterm?
                        <p><strong>Data point = George's exam grade = 79</strong>, <strong>mean = 83</strong>, <strong>standard deviation = 2</strong>. Let's substitute these into the formula:</p>
                        <p><em>z</em> = (data point - mean) / standard deviation</p>
                        <p><em>z</em> = (79 - 83) / 2</p>
                        <p><em>z</em> = (-4) / 2 = <strong>-2</strong></p>
                        <p class="text-blue">&#8756; George's <strong>z-score is -2</strong>, meaning his grade is <strong>a half of a standard deviation <u>below</u> the mean</strong>.</p>
                    </li>

                <h2 class="yellow-bg" id="r-score-formula">Understanding the R-Score Formula</h2>
                <p>Since March 2018, the BCI has used the following <strong>formula to calculate an R-Score in a single course</strong> (<em>recall that R-Scores are calculated for each of your college courses</em>):</p>
                <h4 class="text-blue"><em>R<sub>course</sub> = </em>(<em>Z </em>&#8901; <em>IDGZ</em> + <em>IFGZ</em> + 5) &#8901; 5</h4>
                <p><strong>Let's go over each component:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em><strong>Z</strong></em> = <strong>your z-score for the course</strong>
                        <ul class="inner ul-blue">
                            <li>(your course grade - the course mean) / the course standard deviation</li>
                            <li>Notice that here, <strong>your course grade = the data point</strong> (in the z-score formula)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><em><strong>IFGZ</strong></em> = <em>l'indicateur de la force du groupe</em> (the <u>third</u> component: we'll go over this first so that the IDGZ makes more sense)
                        <ul class="inner ul-blue">
                            <li>This component measures the so-called <strong>strength of the group</strong></li>
                            <li>Students in the course are given <strong>high school z-scores</strong>, which are z-scores based on their academic performance in certain
                            standardized (ministerial) high school courses</li>
                            <li>The IFGZ is the <strong>average of these high school z-scores</strong> (the <strong>mean</strong>): (sum of student high school z-scores) / (number of z-scores)</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><em><strong>IDGZ</strong></em> = <em>l'indicateur de la dispersion du groupe</em> (the <u>second</u> component)

                            <li>This measures the <strong>dispersion of the high school z-scores of you and your classmates</strong> for a course. In other words, the IDGZ

                <p>Now that we understand how the R-Score is calculated, how does it work and what does it actually do? Let's take another
                look at the formula, specifically the IDGZ component:</p>
                <h4 class="text-blue"><em>R<sub>course</sub> = </em>(<em>Z </em>&#8901; <em><strong>IDGZ</strong></em> + <em>IFGZ</em> + 5) &#8901; 5</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The IDGZ (group dispersion) <strong>multiplies</strong> the college course z-score</li>
                    <li>The formula adjusts, depending on the IDGZ value, the <strong>weight</strong> of:
                        <ul class="inner">
                            <li>Your performance in the course <em>(Z)</em></li>
                            <li>The group strength <em>(IFGZ)</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>For simplicity, let's disregard the two aesthetic 5s:</strong></p>
                <h4 class="text-blue"><em>R<sub>course</sub> = </em>(<em>Z </em>&#8901; <em><strong>IDGZ</strong></em> + <em>IFGZ</em>)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the <strong>IDGZ &#60; 1</strong>, the value of (Z &#8901; IDGZ) <u>decreases</u>. Therefore, the <strong>weight/importance of your performance in the course is diminished</strong> relative to the group strength (IFGZ).
                        <ul class="inner ul-blue">
                            <li>What does it mean if the IDGZ &#60; 1? Since the IDGZ is the <strong>course group's z-score standard deviation</strong> and is <strong>limited to a range of 0.5 to 1.5</strong>, IDGZ &#60; 1 means that there's <strong>less spread/distribution</strong> in your course group.</li>
                            <li>Less spread = the high school z-scores of your course group are all quite similar/close to each other and have a smaller
                            range (the difference between the highest and lowest z-scores is smaller)</li>
                            <li>(<em>Lower standard deviation = a set of data points are more closely grouped, are closer in value</em>)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If the <strong>IDGZ &#62; 1</strong>, the value of (Z &#8901; IDGZ) <u>increases</u>. Therefore, the <strong>weight/importance of your performance in the course
                        is amplified</strong> (increased) relative to the group strength (IFGZ).
                        <ul class="inner ul-blue">
                            <li>What does it mean if the IDGZ &#62; 1? A higher standard deviation means that the data points in a data set are <strong>more spread
                            out</strong>, and since the IDGZ is the group's dispersion/standard deviation, a <strong>higher IDGZ (&#62; 1) means that there's more spread</strong> in
                            your course group.</li>
                            <li>More spread = the high school z-scores of your course group vary quite a bit have a wider range (the difference between
                            the highest and lowest z-scores of the group is larger)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Because the IDGZ is capped between 0.5 and 1.5, <strong>your performance in a course will always remain an important factor in R-Score
                    calculation</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class="text-blue"><strong>To summarize these points:</strong></p>
                <ul>

                <p><strong>Now, let's go over how and where the R-Score is used, as well as some useful facts:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individual R-Scores are calculated for <strong>each CEGEP course</strong>.
                        <ul class="inner ul-blue">
                            <li>Provided at least six students in the course group achieve a percentage grade of 50% or above (<em>if you do not receive an R-Score for a course, this condition was likely not met</em>)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>An <strong>overall R-Score</strong> is calculated as the <strong>weighted average of all course R-Scores</strong> (the weight of each R-Score depends on
                    the number of credits the course is worth).
                        <ul class="inner ul-blue">
                            <li>Failed courses count for less in your overall R-Score; that is, they are given less weight in the calculation of your
                            overall R-Score.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>R-Scores usually fall between <strong>15 and 40</strong>.</li>
                    <li>A high R-Score is typically said to be 30 and above.
                        <ul class="inner ul-blue">
                            <li>Extremely competitive programs such as Law, Medicine, and Dentistry generally require an R-Score in this range</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When calculating the IFGZ (average of high school z-scores), the following secondary school courses are taken into
                    account:
                        <ul class="inner ul-blue">
                            <li>Secondary 4 History</li>
                            <li>Secondary 4 Science</li>
                            <li>Secondary 4 Math</li>
                            <li>Secondary 5 Language of Instruction (English/Français)</li>
                            <li>Secondary 5 Second Language (Français/English)</li>
                        </ul>

                <p>The R-Score is used by <strong>Quebec</strong> universities for <strong>admissions purposes in addition to other criteria</strong> (<em>admission essay, CV,
                interview, etc.</em>). R-Score cutoffs are often set for programs, and these cutoffs can be found on university websites
                (<em>note that cutoffs may vary from year to year!</em>). Here are some examples for <u>2021</u>:</p>
                <ul class="ul-blue">
                    <li>McGill Finance: 28.30 overall R-Score</li>
                    <li>Concordia Art History: 19</li>
                    <li>Concordia Computer Science: 28 overall, 26 math</li>
                    <li>McGill Electrical Engineering: 29.80 overall R-Score</li>
